# This project contains two programs to fulfill the coding challenge from LightFeather.io

ShiftCipher
Encode and Decode Strings using a Shift Cipher AKA Ceasar Shift.

RegistrationForm
Simple Registration form and validation

Both programs use node.js and were developed using node 12.0.0

To Execute ShiftCipher, start in the root folder then:

    cd ShiftCipher
    node .
    
Then use the postman project provided, to call the api to apply the shift cipher and I've also suplied an api to decode the cipher.

To Execute Registration form go back to the root then:

    cd RegistrationForm
    node .

then navigate to localhost and the Registration form will come up.
